    <h2>Styles</h2>

    <p>The following style guidelines are applied consistently across all documents.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The <code>code</code> tag is used to represent text written in the language. It should not be used in constrained contexts, such as table headers or hover-only text.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <i>italic</i> tag is used for IPA transcriptions, including both phonemic and phonetic representations. It may also be employed to indicate emphasis, exceptionality, or special importance.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <b>bold</b> or <strong>strong</strong> tag is used to highlight emphasis or critical information.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blockquotes are used to present optional notes or additional information that may aid understanding or context.
        </li>
        <li>
            The combination <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> is used for full-sentence examples, multi-line code, or any code content that requires preservation of formatting and line breaks.
        </li>
    </ul>
