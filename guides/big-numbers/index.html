    <p>
        <b>Hello there!</b> This is a simple guide on how to read large numbers aloud, convert them to scientific notation, and convert back.<br>
        Before we start, it is important to know that there are <b>two types of "scales"</b> for naming large numbers.<br>
        The first is <b>the short scale</b>, which is more commonly used and easier to understand.<br>
        The second is <b>the long scale</b>, which is structured quite differently.<br>
        In this guide, we will focus on <b>the short scale</b>, but I will also provide notes on how numbers are read in the long scale.<br>
        With that stated, let's dive right in!
    </p>

    <h1 id="number-scientific">The Scientific Notation</h1>

    <p>
        In this section, you are going to learn <b>the scientific notation system</b>, which is a very efficient way of transcripting large numbers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="number-scientific-basics">The Basics</h2>

    <p>
        A scientific notation is made up with three (or more*) parts.<br>
        All numbers in scientific notation can be represented in this form below;
    </p>

    <pre><code>x e y</code></pre>

    <p>
        The variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> represent <b>the mantissa</b> and <b>the exponent</b> accordingly.<br>
    </p>

    <h1 id="number-short-scale">The Short Scale</h1>

    <p>
        In this section, you are going to learn <b>the short scale</b>, and what scientific notation value corresponds to each.<br>
        It gets pretty irregular though, so be ready to remember lots of suffixes!
